        "- Focus ONLY on direct agent-object interactions (e.g., 'grip', 'pull', 'where to hold') or agent-multi-object interactions (e.g., 'where to cut food with').",
        "- Do NOT include descriptions that merely state object functionality without agent action. Examples of what to avoid: 'swings open' for a cabinet door, 'stores items' for a drawer. Instead use: 'pull to open' for a cabinet door, 'place items in' for a drawer.",
        "- Distinct Functional Parts Rule: Carefully identify when a functionally distinct part (like a knife tip, scissor point, or button) has been separated into its own cluster. Each distinct functional part should receive its own specific action descriptions relating to its unique purpose, even if it's part of a larger component (like a blade).",
        "- Region Granularity Rule: If different functional parts that serve SIMILAR purposes are grouped into the same cluster, describe the main functionality for the entire region.",

        "- Only propose descriptions for regions that have common, practical actions associated with them.",
